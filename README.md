# Rosetta Boulder

This is a library that will contain a class that will extract the data from a research paper ??? and replicate the statistics from said paper. This data will be used to correlate future data and compare it to their findings.

## Todo:

- [ ] Replicate lattice's findings
    - [ ] Build a class that extracts the data
    - [ ] Create a function that will estimate the climbing grade based on the results 
    - [ ] Test the output with the one on the paper

- [ ] Move the data to a database that can be easily extracted
